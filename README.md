Welome to UNO!


~Card Types:
	~In all four colors(red, yellow, green and blue):
		-(Number Cards) 0 to 9 number cards
		-(Action Cards)
			-(<=>) reverse : reverse the turns (example: instead of going from player 1 to player 2 to player 3, if player2 plays reverse then the next player is player 1 and then player 3 and then player2..)
			-(+2) draw two : next player draws 2 cards and doesn't play
			-(/) skip : skips the next player
	~Wild Cards: these cards don't need to match the previous card on the Discard Pile, no color requirements.
		-(%) Change color: the player must state the color the next player needs to play.
		-(+4) draw for : this cards acts as a combination of change color and 2 (+2) cards.

~Basic Game Rules:
	-There can be from 1 to 5 players. (player1, player2, etc.. )
	-Each player starts with 7 cards.
	-Every player can only have 9 cards in hand at any time, then they hit limit.
	-Players put their played cards in a Discard Pile. Once a new card is discarded the older one is deleted.
	-The game starts with one card in the Discard Pile that isn't an action/symbol or a wild card.
	-In every turn each player tries to play a card that matches the color, number or action/symbol as the last card in the pile.
	-If there isn't in their hand, they can draw until they hit limit then they pass.
	-The first player to finish all the cards in their hand wins.
